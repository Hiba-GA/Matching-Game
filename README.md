## Description
This is a simple memory game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Players flip cards to find matching pairs.  
- Win: Match all pairs before the timer ends.  
- Lose: Time runs out before all pairs are matched.  

I chose this game because it is fun and helps practice DOM logic.
